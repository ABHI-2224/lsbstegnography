# LSB Steganography

LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography is a technique used to hide information within digital media, such as images, by altering the least significant bits of the pixel values. This script provides a Python implementation of LSB steganography, allowing users to encode and decode messages within image files.

# Features
Encode Message: Encode a message into an image using LSB steganography.
Decode Message: Decode a hidden message from an image using LSB steganography.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
PIL (Python Imaging Library)

# Installation
Clone the repository : git clone https://github.com/ABHI-2224/lsbsteganography.git

# Navigate to the project directory : 
cd lsb-steganography
